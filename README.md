# Data
The data files are rather large so rather than filling the whole git repo with uncompressed text they are compressed in the data folder in data.tar.gz 
Once extracted there are two files:
* plaintext-olddata.txt
    * This is plain text from a old dump of simple wiki from a git repo I found 
    * Size - 32 MB
* simplewiki-20180301-pages-meta-current.xml 
    * This is a very large XML file containing more up to date data but also additional meta data. The text is in wiki format and would need processing to become usable.
    * Size - 1.6 GB
