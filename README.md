# Data
The data files are rather large so rather than filling the whole git repo with uncompressed text they are compressed in the data folder in plaintext-olddata.tar.gz 
Once extracted there is one file:
* plaintext-olddata.txt
    * This is plain text from a old dump of simple wiki from a git repo I found 
    * Size - 256 MB
	
More up to date data can be downloaded from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/simplewiki/20180301/
Here you can download the following:
* simplewiki-20180301-pages-meta-current.xml 
    * This is a very large XML file containing more up to date data but also additional meta data. The text is in wiki format and would need processing to become usable.
    * Size - 8.5 GB
