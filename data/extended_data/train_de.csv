id27184,"Diotima approached the fountain, sat down on a mossy hill beside her, and her disciples stood on the grass beside her. Without noticing me, who was sitting close under her, she continued with her speech, as it happened to one of her listeners, before I wanted to repeat her words I will call the head of those who wished to impress her chiefly. A woman of about years was in full enjoyment of the most beautiful beauty, her golden hair swam in curls on her shoulders, her dull eyes were shaded heavy eyelids and her mouth seemed to breathe the lips Sensibility But she seemed thoughtfully unhappy her cheek was pale she seemed as usual, and as if the lessons she now heard were the only words of wisdom she had ever heard of youth beside her had a very different aspect; his figure was almost emaciated, his features were handsome, but thin, his eyes gleaming as if they enlivened the face of decay. His forehead was expressive, but there was a dubious confusion in his eyes. Although he had sought wisdom, he was entangled in mysterious labyrinths from which he sought in vain to free himself. When Diotima spoke, his color came with rapid changes the flexible muscles of his face showed every impression his mind received, he seemed one who had studied hard in life, whose limp frame sank under the weight of the mere exertion of life, the spark the intelligence burned in him with unusual strength, but that of life seemed to be on the eve of fading. For the moment I will not describe anything of this group, but with deep attention try to remember some of the words of Diotima, they were fire words, but their way is faintly drawn, if I remember a fair hand, she said, continued with her speech to separate good from evil. On Earth, they are inextricably intertwined, and if you throw that away, an evil will appear a multitude of beneficial causes or effects clinging to it mocking your work When I was on earth and wandering in a lonely land during the stillness of the night You have seen the multitude of stars, the soft radiation of the moon reflecting on the sea. When I felt the soft breeze rising over my cheek, when the words of love that had appeased her appealed to me, mine seemed Spirit almost left the body that limited him to the earth with a quick spiritual sense With the scene I barely saw I felt Then I exclaimed: O world, how beautiful you are, brightest universe, see your worshiping spirit of beauty the sympathy that pervades everything, now lifts my soul as with wings, how have you animated the light the breezes depth inexplicable spirit give me words to my A to express adoration; My mind has hurried away, but with language I can not say how I feel your loveliness. Silence, or the song of the nightingale, the instantaneous appearance of a bird quietly passing by, seems more alive than the sky full of worlds. Winds roared the sea, and the terrible lightning seemed to fall around me, yet love mingled with the holy terror I felt, the majesty of loveliness was deeply impressed by me. I also felt when I saw a lovely face or heard solemn music The eloquence of divine wisdom flowing from the lips of one of her worshipers, a lovely animal, or even the graceful waves of inanimate trees, have aroused in me the same profound feeling of loveliness He was an animator of the scene, but he conveyed to me through his depth, as if I had already found the solution to my questions, as if I were myself as a part Feeling the Great Whole In Which I Found The Truth But when I retired to my cell, I thought about the various movements and actions in the world. The weight of evil has confused me. When I thought of the Creation, I saw an eternal chain of evil, connected with the Great Whale swallowing in the sea, destroying the masses, the smaller fish living on it torment it also to the madness of the cat, whose pleasure it is is to torture their prey. I saw the whole creation in pain, every creature seems to exist through the misery of another's death. Devastation is the slogan of the living world.
